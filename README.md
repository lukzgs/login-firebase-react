Login with Google(soon other platforms)

- `npm install`
- `npm start`

and thats it...

This is just a piece of a greater project.

In this project I choose the following frameworks and libs:
- `ReactJS`
- `Firebase`
- `TailwindCSS`
- `react-dom`
- `react-router-dom`
- `react-firebase-hooks`

Feel free to use this code.
